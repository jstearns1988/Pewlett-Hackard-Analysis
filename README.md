# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Overview
This analysis was performed to sort retirment data for Pewlett Hackard and determine the number of employees who are retiring per title, as well as identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Several data tables were created to sort employees eligible for retirement by birth date, start date, and end date. For this analysis, new tables were created to separate the retiring titles and mentorship eligibility data.

### Retiring Titles
  - As seen in the Retiring Titles table, the largest group of employees retiring are Senior Engineers totalling 29,414. This totals almost a third of the retiring staff. Following closely behind is the Senior Engineers is the Senior Staff group at 28,254.

  - Because there are only 1549 of 90,398 employees eligible for the mentorship program, we see a significant deficit in staff that can train to fill the open positions.

## Summary
We analyzed a total of 90,398 employees retiring in the upcoming "silver tsunami" whose roles will need to be filled. It was determined the majority of the retirees hold senior positions as Senior Engineers and Senior Staff. Only 1549 of the employees qualify for the mentorship program. This means each employee would need to mentor 58 employees. Pewlett Hackard will need more mentors to successfully fill the roles of the retirees. I suggest the company changes their requirements for the mentorship program in order to increase the number of mentors who can help fill in the missing spots in the staff.

This analysis lacks data explaining why the mentorship program only includes employees who were born in 1965. I created a new table that expanded the Mentorship eligibility by including employee birth years from 1956 to 1965. I chose 1956 because this is the first year in the analysis that does not include the retiring employees.
This expanded the number of eligible mentors to 167,666. This could mean Pewlett Hackard would have more potential mentors than retirees. A one-on-one approach to mentoring could provide the mentoree with more meaningful attention from their mentor and get them ready to fill a position quicker.

I also wanted to know which departments needed the most mentors to replace their retirees. I created a table that organized each department and their retirees. The Development and Production departments will need the most mentors to replace the staff who is leaving.

If Pewlett Hackard expanded their mentorship eligibility and focused those mentors most on the Development and Production departments, they could avoid feeling the shift of the 90,398 employees who are leaving the company.
